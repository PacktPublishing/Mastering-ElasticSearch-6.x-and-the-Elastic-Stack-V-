## About the Video Course
Elastic Stack is powered by the most popular open source search engine, ElasticSearch, currently used throughout the world by Fortune 500 companies such as Sprint and Dell and small startups who leverage the power and scalability of the Elastic Stack, without having to pay a fortune in licensing or professional services hours. 
Getting ElasticSearch up and running is fairly straightforward, but fully understanding how to use the whole stack, from start to finish, is a rather daunting task. This course will focus on two major use cases with ElasticSearch. The first is leveraging the powerful full-text search engine ElasticSearch is built on, allowing developers to add blazingly fast search features to applications. The second is leveraging different components of the Elastic Stack to continuously monitor applications, infrastructure, or even customer transactions. 
Throughout the course, students will go from a beginner to a master of Elastic Stack, via hands-on examples using real data.
